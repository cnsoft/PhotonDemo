KeySmith AS3 keyboard manager copyright 2011 Stephen Smith
Version 1.3

Changes:
1.3	
-Better implementation of Singleton pattern
-Reverted member functions names. Doesn't affect usability.
-Fixed a few bugs (improper function calls and warnings)
-Removed ADDED_TO_STAGE event listener after it's been added.

1.2
-Fixed 'S' being right and 'D' being down.
-Got rid of the derpy changeKeySet method, added much better implementation of it.
-Renamed KeyboardManager to KeySmith to keep naming convention.
-Added KeySmith.init() function. Must be called before using it.
-Added singleton for KeySmith, now functions are accessed by calling KeySmith.<method name>

1.1
-Fixed copying over a key set changing that key set
-Added an error message (given via trace()) in changeKeySet if no proper set was given.
-Added two new methods: keyCodeState and prevKeyCodeState. Both check the state of a given key by its keyCode (e.g. Keyboard.A) instead of an alias.
-Added a trace statement to the ADDED_TO_STAGE event to let the user know it should be loaded and working.

"How do I set this up?"
1: Download the zip folder.
2: Add the KeySmith folder to your project folder.
3: Be sure to import everything:
	import KeySmithCode.KeySmith;
	import KeySmithCode.Enums.Keys;
	import KeySmithCode.Enums.KeySets;
	import flash.ui.Keyboard;
4: Your code should look something like this:
	package Code {

		import KeySmithCode.KeySmith;
		import KeySmithCode.Enums.Keys;
		import KeySmithCode.Enums.KeySets;
		import flash.ui.Keyboard;
		
		public class Document extends MovieClip {
			
			public function Document() {
